## Introduction

Prisma is an sql-orm for typescript. With excellent DX, it gains a lot of favorite among Fullstack Developers. 

But it really sucks in serverless environment, it takes a distinct delay for a GraphQL cold start time.

And this time an alternative solution **Drizzle Orm** come into my view.

Just like Prisma, Drizzle Orm provides type-safety and easy to use query-chain syntax

and fast query execution. 

But it has these Cons
- In an early stage (Many features are not stable)
- Not unified support (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Has to do a little setup to use drizzle-kit

After hearing Prisma v5 update, I go back to give it a try.
[In Prisma v5](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-5-f66prwkjx72s), they replace GraphQL Engine with JSON protocol
and speed up to 9x times faster

After a week ago using it, I thought prisma improves a lot, but drizzle orm is a little bit faster
maybe 100ms vs 300ms. And I decide to come back. Here is the reasons

1. Prisma has much more resources (community & ecosystems)
2. Prisma is easy to deal with migrations
3. Prisma schema is more precise and clearly

But Drizzle is still faster.

Conclusion, if you are a beginner to sql, please don't just write raw sql. Use it with orm
to ensure type-safety and make your code structured. Prisma and Drizzle are both nice choices.
