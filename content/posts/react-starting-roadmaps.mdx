## Introduction

There are tons of resource to learn web development nowadays. Today I'm going to tell you
how to get started with React quickly.

## Online sources rather than books

The content of books may be outdating. Also, you should use books rather than reading books.
### For example
- use [Create Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) ✅
or [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app) ✅ rather than [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) ❌
- use **hooks** rather than **Class Components** 

Note that [usehooks-ts](https://usehooks-ts.com) is a nice way to learn hooks
### Nice online sources

- Youtube
- Udemy
- Open source projects (**Recommand**)

See [Nice Resource For React](/posts/nice-resource-react)

## Play with typescript
### Pros
- Make your project into controll, reduce the unexpected error.
- Typescript Ecosystem is nice to use, [Zod](https://zod.dev), [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/) ...
### Cons
- You have to learn typescript.

## Choose a easy way to Deploy your apps at first
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com), 
[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) >>> [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)

These choice saves you lots of time

## Don't think too much about rerenders
Please don't misapply useMemo or useCallback in your app.
